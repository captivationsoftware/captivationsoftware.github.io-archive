    <p>
      Captivation Software is a small, developer-oriented company that embraces the progressive attitude

      We actively pursue the most interesting work the Intelligence Community has to offer.

        <strong>Above-market hourly pay</strong>
        <p>We are able to pay substantially higher rates than larger companies thanks to our highly-efficient business model. A 30-50% raise over a previous employer isn't unheard of!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"Early Retirement" 20% 401k contribution</strong>
        <p>Yes, you read that correctly - we contribute <strong>20%</strong> of your earned wages to your 401k plan every year. How does retiring early sound?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax-advantaged medical coverage</strong>
        <p>Opt in to our company-sponsored HSA plan to enjoy exceptional tax benefits while investing in your own health and well-being for years to come. It's a win-win!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Paid Time Off ( PTO )</strong>
        <p>
          Even though we pay our engineers by the hour, we still provide a generous amount of paid time off for use at your own discretion!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recruiting bonus</strong>
        <p>Refer a friend and get a bonus after 6 months of employment. This deal is open to non-employees as well!</p>
