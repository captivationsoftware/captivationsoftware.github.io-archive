    <h3>Scaling Horizontally</h3>
    <p>
      With application clustering, you gain the ability to boost computing power in
      your various services through the addition of commodity hardware. When compared with
      expensive specialty upgrades, clustered solutions provide the same results with the
      added benefit of fault tolerance inherent to a multi-node setup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before scaling your existing infrastructure vertically with expensive hardware upgrades,
      {% include link.html href="/contact/" %} to see if a clustered solution works better for your needs.

    <h3>More Processing Power</h3>
    <p>
      Clustered applications are services running on separate hosts that are accessible
      as if they were a single machine. This gives you the ability to continually add more
      cores as your operation grows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Used in conjunction with our
      {% include link.html href="/services/application-development/data-management/" %}
      services, your persistence layer will be ready to handle even the largest
      data sets.
    </p>

    <h3>Redundancy For Increased Uptime</h3>
    <p>
      Most application clusters have the ability to replicate data across many nodes, such
      that in the event of a malfunction, your data remains accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For solutions hosted via
      {% include link.html text="Cloud Services" href="/services/devops/cloud-deployments/" %}, this
      redundancy can easily be extended to data centers located around the globe for
      unparalleled data protection.
