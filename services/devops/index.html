    <h3>Into the cloud</h3>
    <p>
      By now, "the cloud" has become something of a household term when it comes to
      <em>data storage</em>, but it actually has far more to offer than that. Cloud
      computing services are an exciting possibility for organizations looking to
      outsource some of their infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leveraging popular cloud service providers like <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Heroku</strong>
      greatly simplifies how you deploy your custom software application, and lessens the need for
      dedicated maintenance staff.

    <h3>Fewer Surprises</h3>
    <p>
      Every IT infrastructure bears a degree of complexity, with larger systems
      being harder to isolate and diagnose issues for as they arise. This complexity is
      compounded by one-off fixes and band-aids applied incompletely across the enterprise.
      This is a risk to any organization that relies on software systems for their day-to-day
      operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through our dedicated DevOps services, you offset the inherent risk in any system
      architecture by eliminating the most preventable points of failure in IT systems:
      human error.

    <h3>Increased Uptime</h3>
    <p>
      Every organization has some key systems that, if this system happened to go down, would
      render your staff completely unable to work for a period of time. Unfortunately for
      many, this situation is a common one, and is a great source of frustration and expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      IT Automation has a positive impact on an organization's ability to allocate
      new system resources or replace aging ones without major headaches. Used in combination
      with {% include link.html href="/services/devops/application-clustering/" %}, your
      system services can gain an unprecedented level of robustness
