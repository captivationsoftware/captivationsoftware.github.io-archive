    <h3>Custom to your specifications</h3>
    <p>
      Off the shelf software solutions are general purpose tools designed to meet the needs of
      a wide and diverse audience. These types of solutions are limited to the decisions made by
      a software team without your input, and has the unfortunate side-effect of changing the way
      your organization operates to remain effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom software, by contrast, is compromise-free and will be built entirely to your own specifications,
      to include all the features you want, and none of those you don't. Further, our team is there every
      step of the way to help with the decision making process - ensuring a software solution that compliments
      your organization and provides optimal results for years to come.

    <h3>Stateless for scalability</h3>
    <p>
      Modern software development best practices encourages designing for horizontal scalability. As part of this
      approach, we build stateless applications that are more fault-tolerant, reliable, and expandable than
      outdated, stateful counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deliver scalable solutions by providing stateless {% include link.html href="/services/application-development/web-services-and-apis/" %}
      in combination with our {% include link.html href="/services/devops/application-clustering/" %} services.</a>
