    <h3>Streaming Web Applications</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional web applications rely on polling for updates or user interaction ( e.g.
      clicking a "refresh" button ) to retrieve fresh data. This strategy works
      well for some systems, but leaves much to be desired in environments that experience
      a high volume of events that must be responded to immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this problem, we build streaming web applications using HTML5 WebSockets
      and Socket.io, reliably extending capabilities in mission critical and collaborative
      settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Pub / Sub Architectures</h3>
    <p>
      Applications that process large volumes of data synchronously can quickly overrun even
      the most powerful servers. Long running jobs and computationally expensive operations
      compound this problem, and an intelligent solution is required to meet the demands of
      such an application despite these challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Publisher / Subscriber ( <small>Pub / Sub</small> ) pattern solves this problem by decoupling
      processing with an <em>asynchronous</em> data flow - processing jobs are scheduled, and clients
      are notified when jobs are completed. Integrating this pattern into your application will
      deliver greater throughput alongside dependable performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Webhook APIs</h3>
    <p>
      Webhooks are a powerful mechanism available to organizations wishing to provide
      Software-as-a-Service ( <small>SaaS</small> ) to many third-party integrators,
      providing clients with the ability to register external actions to be performed
      in response to pre-configured events.
    </p>
    <p>
      By incorporating a Webhook API into your system(s), you gain a high-performance
      advantage in the value provided to your clients.
