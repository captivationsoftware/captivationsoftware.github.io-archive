    <h3>Relational Databases</h3>
    <p>
      We design and implement data schemas for use with major
      Relational Database Management Systems ( <small>RDBMS</small> ), such as Oracle,
      PostgreSQL, and MySQL. These solutions are suitable for data sets with highly
      relational data, and provides space-efficient storage with powerful querying
      capabilities.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="small-caps">NoSQL</span> Solutions</h3>
    <p>
      Recent advances in data management have given rise to so-called "NoSQL" solutions.
      We utilize these solutions when non-relational data must be persisted,
      or when the benefits of a NoSQL solution can be used to complement an existing RDBMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide data services using popular NoSQL solutions, including MongoDB
      and Redis, leveraging their efficiency and reduced development costs for our clients.
    </p>

    <h3>Full Text Searching</h3>
    <p>
      Full Text Search engines, such as Elasticsearch and Solr, provide the extra
      horsepower needed to query large data sets with flexibility and efficiency.
      These tools are hard-to-beat in terms of response times while retrieving records,
      and are unmatched in their advanced query support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, integrating a Full Text Search engine into an existing application is
      a proven way to build upon your existing capabilities without having to completely
      redesign your codebase.
