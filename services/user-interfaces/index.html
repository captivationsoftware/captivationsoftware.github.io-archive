    <h3>The face of your application</h3>
    <p>
      The user interface ( or "UI" ) of your application is one of the most important aspects
      of your custom software. It acts as the control panel to your workflows, and can either be
      the greatest source of productivity, or when done poorly, the greatest source of frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our UI experts will ensure your application is intuitive and attractive, with
      many conveniences like immediate feedback, status updates, progress indicators, and
      easy to understand alerts and error messages.
    </p>

    <h3>Build once, use everywhere</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional applications were designed to work solely on a desktop computer, making them
      cumbersome to use on other devices, such as phones or tablets. These applications are costly
      to convert to a mobile-friendly alternative, or require an entirely seperate application
      for mobile altogether. We avoid this problem altogether by incorporating
      {% include link.html href="/services/user-interfaces/responsive-design/" %}
      into every application we deliver for our clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using our team, your application will be usable and enjoyably for every user,
      regardless of their preferred device.
    </p>

    <h3>Standards Compliance</h3>
    <p>
      The web is a diverse place, and it is important to follow the established rules to
      get the best results for your users - be they a person, a search engine, or assistive
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our front end technology is designed to deliver the best results with the
      fewest surprises. Additionally, you may take your application even further with
      accessibility considerations, like 508 compliance, to enable users with special needs.
