    <h3>Interactive Presentation</h3>
    <p>
      Static charts and graphs leave much to be desired when related data is
      inaccessible or difficult to access. Users need to explore and refine their
      data, and many standard graphing solutions leave much to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      We enhance your visualizations with tooltips, context menu's, and user event
      handlers that customize the presentation for the task at hand, and provide your
      users with the feedback they require.

    <h3>High-Performance Graphics</h3>
    <p>
      Visually intensive graphics are proven to better engage your users and provide
      greater understanding, but demand more from an end-user's system. Managing performance
      versus quality is a balancing act that requires the help of experts to deliver the
      best results.

      Our UI team is experienced in using advanced virtualization techniques and algorthims to deliver
      optimized results on any system without sacrificing the user experience.
