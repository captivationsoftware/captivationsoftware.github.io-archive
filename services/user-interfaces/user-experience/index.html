    <h3>More than just graphic design</h3>
    <p>
      User experience ( <small>UX</small> ) design is a merging of graphic design,
      information architecture, and interaction design. Unfortunately, many teams have the
      tendency to let the graphic design component drive the UX design process, yielding mixed
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our disciplined UX professionals go beyond providing "UX in name only" and focus on striking
      the balance between aesthetics and architecture that works for your target audience.

    <h3>A Focus on Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Every organization that receives federal funding must be <strong>508 compliant</strong> -
      meaning special attention must be paid to ensure that any software developed is
      accessible by people with disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide 508 compliance services that will make your application more accessible to
      those with disabilities.  
    </p>

    <h3>Listening To Your Users</h3>
    <p>
      The best UX results come from a design process that begins with input from those
      who will use the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider the input and perspectives of your audience, from the subject matter expert to
      the complete novice, and develop intuitive interfaces that meet their real-world requirements
      without compromise.
