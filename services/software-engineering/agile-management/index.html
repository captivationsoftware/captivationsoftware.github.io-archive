    <h3>Developing User Stories</h3>
    <p>
      Your application users have a story to tell, and the Agile method was developed
      to bring these stories to the forefront. Through this style of project management,
      we ensure that the features that are delivered are a reflection of your organization's
      operational requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Iterative Progression</h3>
    <p>
      Every step in the development cycle is an opportunity to verify that what
      is delivered matches expectations. We promote the practice of frequent
      demonstrations to showcase completed features and gather the feedback
      necessary to shape future iterations.
    </p>

    <h3>Daily Course Correction</h3>
    <p>
      As part of Agile methods, we promote the practice of daily standup ( a.k.a "scrum" ).
      Doing so encourages your development team to shed light on any issues or roadblocks
      that may be impeding progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      This daily routine also serves as a way to quickly share relevant updates on large
      applications, and more evenly distributes application expertise amongst team members.
