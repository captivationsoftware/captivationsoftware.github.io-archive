    <h3>A Strong Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      Accurate domain modeling is essential to the long-term success of your project -
      it is also an aspect of development that is often overlooked, and with painful consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take the time to make sure what is modeled in code has a real-world equivalent. This avoids
      technical debt and mitigates headaches down the road. Additional benefits include the ability
      to add features without adding complexity, and decreasing overall maintenance costs.
    </p>

    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>
      We employ Object-Oriented Programming ( <small>OOP</small> ) to effectively model the intricacies
      of your workflows. Through this technique, we are able to concisely represent the
      hierarchies and relationships of your system components.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Object-Oriented Programming, your application is able to leverage powerful
      abstractions, consolidating code for maintainability and maximizing correctness.
    </p>

    <h3>Programmatic Testing</h3>
    <p>
      As part of our comprehensive approach to domain modeling, we take special care to
      ensure each aspect of your designed workflow behaves as expected through the use of
      programmatic testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tests, commonly referred to as "unit tests", assert that the schema we deliver
      is valid, protecting your investment and reducing the likelihood of faulty releases.
