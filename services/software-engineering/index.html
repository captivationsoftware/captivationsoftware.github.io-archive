    <h3>Comprehensive Solutions</h3>
    <p>
      From requirements gathering and rapid prototyping to full scale
      system design and deployment, our team is ready to tackle any
      problem in the digital domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our developers use popular, well-supported open-source tools to build
      your custom software. This not only saves you considerable money up
      front, but also shields you from any expensive overhauls caused by
      vendor lock-in.
    </p>

    <h3>Proactive, not Reactive</h3>
    <p>
      Scope creep, technical debt, and unforeseen complexity are the usual
      culprits when it comes to delayed releases and missed deadlines.
      Employing active strategies to identify and prevent these measures is
      key to your projects success.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of our proactive approach, we practice the Agile methodology,
      which has been proven to avoid the common pitfalls and keep a project on
      track. Learn more by visiting the {% include link.html href="/services/software-engineering/agile-management/" %}

    <h3>User-Oriented Workflows</h3>
    <p>
      Technology is not meant to be self-serving, yet some solutions
      only consider the human element as an afterthought. Any time the
      tool defines the workflow, and not vice versa, frustration is
      certain to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of our software engineering services, we bring the needs
      of the user to the forefront and tailor simple software workflows
      to your specifications, bringing efficiency and enjoyment to the
      way you do business.
