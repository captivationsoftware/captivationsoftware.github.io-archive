    <h3>Make the most of what you have </h3>
    <p>
      It isn't always necessary to reinvent the wheel, and chances are you already have software that
      is readily enhanced. Many modern off-the-shelf solutions provide an application interface ( API )
      for your organization-specific customizations.
    </p>

    <h3>Command-and-Control</h3>
    <p>
      We offer the ability to unify many of your current systems under one roof,
      exposing the functionality of your individual systems through a streamlined
      dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, it is possible to automate some of your tasks across systems, bringing
      new levels of efficiency and productivity to your processes.
    </p>

    <h3>End-to-end Testing</h3>
    <p>
      When integrating complex systems, the need for end-to-end testing becomes essential. As more systems
      are added to the data processing pipeline, these tests are utilized to offset the inherent uncertainty.
