      <h3>New capability: Software-Defined Radio</h3>
      <p>In addition to our existing capabilities within the full-stack development / R&amp;D vertical, key talent acquisition has opened up a realm of exciting opportunities for Captivation Software within the field of Software Defined Radio ( SDR ).</p>
      <p>Software-Defined Radio is an exciting technology that enables drastic cost-cutting measures without sacrificing results. Capabilities that once required expensive hardware are now enabled by software using specialized algorithms and signal processing techniques. Captivation's team is capable of delivering SDR solutions built on leading platforms, most notably the open-source REDHAWK framework, to deliver big wins to IC customers.</p>
      <p>This solution space is a direct complement to Captivation's existing capabilities, and is another asset in our toolbox as we serve the IC Community / DOD.

      <h3>Continued Open-Source Success</h3>
      <p>Captivation is proving to be a continued winner in its sponsoring of emerging technologies, especially in the JavaScript community.</p>
      <p>As an early adopter of Facebook's popular library ReactJS, our team was able to seize on the moment and present solutions for yet un-implemented capabilities that have since gone on to become the de-facto standard within the ecosystem.</p>
      <p>To date, the project we started and sponsor, <a href="https://github.com/captivationsoftware/react-sticky" target="_blank">react-sticky</a> currently experiences over 50,000 downloads per month according to NPM, and growing!</p>
      <p>As part of our commitment to the growth and vibrance of the Open-Source Community, stay tuned for further announcements regarding new offerings!

      <h1>Featured Research</h1>
      <h2>Fresh out of the lab...</h2>
      <p>As we dive head first into SDR spaces, we've turned our attention towards creating tools that apply our existing expertise in high-performance graphics computing to the signal processing domain.</p>
      <p>
        Without further adieu, we'd like to present a snapshot of our super-secret internal project, RADIOVISION:
        <img src="/images/radiovision.png" title="RADIOVISION Snapshot" style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin: 15px auto; display: block;" />
      </p>
      <p>RADIOVISION is a powerful streaming video broadcaster that uses proprietary and open-source methods to create and broadcast low-latency, dynamic content ( such as the dummy data above ) on the fly in real-time from ad-hoc data sources. Practical use-cases include RF spectrograms or applications requiring web-compatible data stream visualizations.</p>
